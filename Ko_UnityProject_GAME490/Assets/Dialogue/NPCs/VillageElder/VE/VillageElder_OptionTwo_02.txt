Of course!
I don't mind at all!
Firestones...
They are the key to your journey
These red titanite crystals can reignite your torch
You'll need to do this frequently to stay warm
Otherwise, you'll freeze!
But remember...
You can only use them once!
Once a firestone has been used...
You cannot use it again
The energy they provide is very limited...
So be sure to cover as much distance as you can...
And to use your torch to its near fullest...
Only then should you use a firestone

No worries!
You can always ask me anything!
