PLAYER: Uh...
PLAYER: Do you mind explaining your tips again?
VE: 	Of course!
VE: 	I don't mind at all!
VE: 	Firestones...
VE: 	They are the key to your journey
VE: 	These red titanite crystals can reignite your torch
VE: 	You'll need to do this frequently to stay warm
VE: 	Otherwise, you'll freeze!
VE: 	But remember...
VE: 	You can only use them once!
VE: 	Once a firestone has been used...
VE: 	You cannot use it again
VE: 	The energy they provide is very limited...
VE: 	So be sure to cover as much distance as you can...
VE: 	And to use your torch to its near fullest...
VE: 	Only then should you use a firestone
PLAYER: Ah!
PLAYER: Thank you!
VE: 	No worries!
VE: 	You can always ask me anything!
