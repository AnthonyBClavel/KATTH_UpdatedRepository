PLAYER: Are there any tips you can give me?
PLAYER: Like on how to pursue my journey?
VE: 	Yes!
VE: 	Of course!
VE: 	The firestones...
VE: 	They are the key to your journey
VE: 	These red titanite crystals can reignite your torch
VE: 	You'll need to do this frequently to stay warm
VE: 	Otherwise, you'll freeze!
PLAYER: I'll freeze?!
PLAYER: How so?
VE: 	All the lands you'll traverse through are very frigid...
VE: 	So you must sustain your torch at all times!
VE: 	But remember...
VE: 	You can only use them once!
VE: 	Once a firestone has been used...
VE: 	You cannot use it again
VE: 	The energy they provide is very limited...
VE: 	So be sure to cover as much distance as you can...
VE: 	And to use your torch to its near fullest
VE: 	Only then should you use a firestone
PLAYER: I'll be sure to keep that in mind!
PLAYER: Thank you!
VE: 	Use them wisely, Ko
VE: 	If things get difficult...
VE: 	Don't be afraid to backtrack
VE: 	For every great leap forward...
VE: 	You always gotta take two steps back!
