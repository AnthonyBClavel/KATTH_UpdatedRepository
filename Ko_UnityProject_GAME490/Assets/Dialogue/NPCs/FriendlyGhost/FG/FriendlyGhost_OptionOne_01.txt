PLAYER: So...
PLAYER: Why haunt a desolate place like this?
FG: 	To be honest...
FG: 	I couldn't tell ya
FG: 	I was an explorer once
FG: 	But this treacherous mountain ended that story
FG: 	I woke up here and couldn't leave...
FG: 	No matter how hard I tried
FG: 	Now...
FG: 	I guide others like you the best I can
FG: 	That way they can continue and fulfill their adventures
FG: 	Though...
FG: 	Maybe if I stopped...
FG: 	I'd have someone to hang out with
PLAYER: Well...
PLAYER: You got me now!
FG: 	Thanks Ko!
