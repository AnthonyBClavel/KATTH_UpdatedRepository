PLAYER: So...
PLAYER: The red firestones...
PLAYER: How do they reignite a torch's flame?
FVE: 	Ooh!
FVE: 	That's an exciting question!
FVE: 	I can't say that I understand it fully...
FVE: 	But from what I can gather...
FVE: 	It appears that the secret lies within the crystal itself
FVE: 	Within its lattice structure!
FVE: 	You see...
FVE: 	The red firestones aren't actually stones at all!
FVE: 	Instead...
FVE: 	They're a form of a crystal
FVE: 	A kind whose surface is continuous and unbroken
FVE: 	There are no grain boundaries!
FVE: 	Such absence seems to give the firestone this "power"
FVE: 	A unique property that allows it to store heat
FVE: 	This is why you can use them to reignite your flame
FVE: 	Isn't that amazing?!
PLAYER: Very!
FVE: 	Most crystals here don't seem to share this attribute
FVE: 	However...
FVE: 	If my theory is correct...
FVE: 	Then there should be other crystals just like them
FVE: 	But with other unique properties
FVE: 	Properties that can be beneficial to our village
FVE: 	That is what I hope to find in my expedition
FVE: 	Does that answer your question?
PLAYER: Yes...
PLAYER: Yes it does!
FVE: 	Ok cool
FVE: 	Glad I could help!
