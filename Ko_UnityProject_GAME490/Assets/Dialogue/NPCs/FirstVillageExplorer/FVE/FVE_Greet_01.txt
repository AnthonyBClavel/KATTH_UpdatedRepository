Hello there!
Such magnificent radiance!
To think there is such a place as this
A place that overflows with dazzling crystals
To be given the opportunity to examine wonderful gems
It fills me with such joy!
Oh my...
I'm rambling, aren't I?
Did you also come to admire these crystals?
It's quite the eye candy, isn't it?
SWITCH
Ah...
So you're the village elder's firstborn, Ko
I can tell you all that I've learned from studying crystals!
Like how the presence of trace elements...
Irradiation...
And various metals...
All help create complex crystal lattice substitutions...
Resulting in the different colors that we see!

Well...
I guess I shouldn't keep you distracted
You've got a long journey ahead of you
Do you have any questions you'd like to ask?
