PLAYER: Hey!
FVE: 	Hello there!
FVE: 	Such magnificent radiance!
FVE: 	To think there is such a place as this
FVE: 	A place that overflows with dazzling crystals
FVE: 	To be given the opportunity to examine wonderful gems
FVE: 	It fills me with such joy!
FVE: 	Oh my...
FVE: 	I'm rambling, aren't I?
FVE: 	Did you also come to admire these crystals?
FVE: 	It's quite the eye candy, isn't it?
PLAYER: Actually...
PLAYER: I'm here to rekindle the sacred flame
PLAYER: The one at the top of Mount Simisano
PLAYER: To fulfill the sacred rite
PLAYER: To provide the village with warmth
PLAYER: Ya know...
PLAYER: Noble firstborn stuff
FVE: 	Ah...
FVE: 	So you're the village elder's firstborn, Ko
FVE: 	I can tell you all that I've learned from studying crystals!
FVE: 	Like how the presence of trace elements...
FVE: 	Irradiation...
FVE: 	And various metals...
FVE: 	All help create complex crystal lattice substitutions...
FVE: 	Resulting in the different colors that we see!
PLAYER: ...
FVE: 	Well...
FVE: 	I guess I shouldn't keep you distracted
FVE: 	You've got a long journey ahead of you
FVE: 	Do you have any questions you'd like to ask?
