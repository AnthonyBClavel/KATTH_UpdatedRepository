Ah, yes
The red firestones...
I don't understand it fully...
But from what I can gather...
It appears that the secret lies within the crystal itself
Within its lattice structure!
You see...
The red firestones aren't actually stones at all!
Instead...
They're a form of a crystal
A kind whose surface is continuous and unbroken
There are no grain boundaries!
Such absence seems to give the firestone this "power"
A unique property that allows it to store heat
This is why you can use them to reignite your flame
Amazing right?!
