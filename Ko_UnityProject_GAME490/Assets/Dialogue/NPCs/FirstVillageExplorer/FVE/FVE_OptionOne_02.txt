PLAYER: How do the red firestones work again?
PLAYER: Like how do they reignite a torch's flame?
FVE: 	Ah, yes
FVE: 	The red firestones...
FVE: 	I don't understand it fully...
FVE: 	But from what I can gather...
FVE: 	It appears that the secret lies within the crystal itself
FVE: 	Within its lattice structure!
FVE: 	You see...
FVE: 	The red firestones aren't actually stones at all!
FVE: 	Instead...
FVE: 	They're a form of a crystal
FVE: 	A kind whose surface is continuous and unbroken
FVE: 	There are no grain boundaries!
FVE: 	Such absence seems to give the firestone this "power"
FVE: 	A unique property that allows it to store heat
FVE: 	This is why you can use them to reignite your flame
FVE: 	Amazing right?!
PLAYER: Truly
FVE: 	Got another question to ask?
