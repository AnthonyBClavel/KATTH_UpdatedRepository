Not long
A couple of hours maybe
A day at most...
I hope
Ya know...
To be honest
I don't really know for sure
You see...
I lost my pocket watch
I was climbing on the walls of this cave
So if you ever find it...
Would you kindly return it to me?

Thanks!
That would be a big help!
I wonder how long I've been down here for exactly
It would be nice to know
I wouldn't want other villagers getting worried
Ya know...
To think I got lost excavating this cave
Or worse...
