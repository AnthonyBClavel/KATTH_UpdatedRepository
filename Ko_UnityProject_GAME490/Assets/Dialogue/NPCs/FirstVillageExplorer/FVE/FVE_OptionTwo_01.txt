PLAYER: So uh...
PLAYER: How long have you been down here for?
FVE: 	Not long
FVE: 	A couple of hours maybe
FVE: 	A day at most...
FVE: 	I hope
FVE: 	Ya know...
FVE: 	To be honest
FVE: 	I don't really know for sure
FVE: 	You see...
FVE: 	I lost my pocket watch
FVE: 	I was climbing on the walls of this cave
FVE: 	So if you ever find it...
FVE: 	Would you kindly return it to me?
PLAYER: Yea!
PLAYER: Sure thing!
FVE: 	Thanks!
FVE: 	That would be a big help!
FVE: 	I wonder how long I've been down here for exactly
FVE: 	It would be nice to know
FVE: 	I wouldn't want other villagers getting worried
FVE: 	Ya know...
FVE: 	To think I got lost excavating this cave
FVE: 	Or worse...
