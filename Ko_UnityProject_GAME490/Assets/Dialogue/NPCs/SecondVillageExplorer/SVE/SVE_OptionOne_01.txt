PLAYER: Do you know how old this place is?
SVE: 	Hmm...
SVE: 	It's hard to say
SVE: 	It's got to be several hundred years old
SVE: 	Maybe even a thousand!
PLAYER: A thousand?!
PLAYER: Woah...
PLAYER: That's old!
SVE: 	Yes, it is!
SVE: 	I've discovered several interesting objects here
SVE: 	They appear to be handheld devices from the past
SVE: 	Unfortunately, none of them turn on
SVE: 	However...
SVE: 	I did find what appears to be a booklet
SVE: 	It's strangely filled with numbers!
SVE: 	The numbers seem to range from 28 to 31 per page
SVE: 	Whatever that's supposed to mean...
PLAYER: You're right!
PLAYER: That is strange
PLAYER: Hmm...
PLAYER: Maybe the numbers mean something
PLAYER: Like a period of time
SVE: 	Interesting deduction
SVE: 	You know...
SVE: 	You may be onto something
SVE: 	Are you sure you don't want to stick around?
SVE: 	I could really use the help!
SVE: 	Hearing another's perspective can be very useful
PLAYER: I'm sorry...
PLAYER: I can't
PLAYER: Well...
PLAYER: At least not for too long
PLAYER: I gotta get to that sacred flame soon
PLAYER: Before the eclipse comes!
PLAYER: Ya know...
PLAYER: With me being the firstborn child and such
SVE: 	Ah...
SVE: 	No worries then
