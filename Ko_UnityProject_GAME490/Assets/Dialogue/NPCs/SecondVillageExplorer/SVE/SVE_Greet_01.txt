PLAYER: Hey!
SVE: 	Why hello!
SVE: 	I didn't see you there
SVE: 	It's unusual to find others all of the way up here
SVE: 	Did you come to study the technology of the precursors?
PLAYER: Nah...
PLAYER: I'm just passing by
PLAYER: I gotta get to the sacred flame
PLAYER: Ya know...
PLAYER: The one at the top of the mountain
SVE: 	Oh...
SVE: 	I see
SVE: 	So...
SVE: 	You're the bearer of the flame!
PLAYER: Yes...
PLAYER: Yes I am!
PLAYER: An eclipse is on its way
PLAYER: So I must reignite the sacred flame
PLAYER: It'll provide us enough warmth to survive
SVE: 	A noble cause indeed...
SVE: 	Very well, then
SVE: 	The flame you seek lies not much further
SVE: 	But before you go...
SVE: 	Is there anything you would like to know?
