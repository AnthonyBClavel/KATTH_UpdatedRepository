PLAYER: Do you know how this power station works?
SVE: 	Well...
SVE: 	The station is steam powered...
SVE: 	So the wet and cold steam rises from the tower pumps
SVE: 	This is produced directly from the generator...
SVE: 	Within its internal cooling pipes

SVE: 	Within the heat exchange...
PLAYER: ...
