Ooh!
That's an exciting question! 
I can't say that I understand it fully...
But from what I can gather...
It appears that the secret lies within the crystal itself
Within its lattice structure!
You see...
The red firestones aren't actually stones at all!
Rather...
They're a form of a crystal
A kind whose surface is continuous and unbroken
There are no grain boundaries!
Such absence seems to give the firestone this "power"
A unique property that allows it to store heat
This is why you can use them to reignite your flame 
Isn't that amazing?!

Most crystals here don't seem to share this attribute
However...
If my theory is correct...
Then there should be other crystals just like them
But with other unique properties
Properties that can be beneficial to our village
That is what I hope to find in my expedition
Does that answer your question?

Ok cool
