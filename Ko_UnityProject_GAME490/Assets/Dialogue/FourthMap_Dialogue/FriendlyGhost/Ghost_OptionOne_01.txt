To be honest...
I couldn't tell ya
I was an explorer once
But this treacherous mountain ended that story
I woke up here and couldn't leave...
No matter how hard I tried
Now...
I guide others like you the best I can
That way they can continue and fulfill their adventures
Though...
Maybe if I stopped...
I'd have someone to hang out with

Thanks Ko!
