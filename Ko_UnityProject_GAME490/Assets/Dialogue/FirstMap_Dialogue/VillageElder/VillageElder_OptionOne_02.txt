Through failure!
SWITCH
Yes...
Failure!
Let me explain again
Yes...
No one likes failing...
But every time you do so...
You'll gain more wisdom and experience
Enough to create a solution for any situation
Everyone fails at some point in their lives
It's inevitable!
So it's just a matter of learning to get back up...
And keep moving forward!
With that kind of mindset...
You can overcome any obstacle!
SWITCH
No problem kiddo
