Hello son!
SWITCH
Oh, you know...
Just thought I'd see my son one last time
SWITCH
Listen...
Ko
It's going to be quite a journey...
And I want to make sure that you're prepared...
Especially for what lies ahead
SWITCH
I'm sure you can, Ko
But you still need know...
SWITCH
The greatest lesson you'll learn...
SWITCH
Patience
Patience...patience...patience!
When things aren't going your way...
You be patient!
Never give up!
A solution will always come!
It'll only be a matter of time before you encounter one
SWITCH
Now go my son...
Fulfill thy rite of passage...
And save us from our upcoming frigid demise
SWITCH
Of course!
