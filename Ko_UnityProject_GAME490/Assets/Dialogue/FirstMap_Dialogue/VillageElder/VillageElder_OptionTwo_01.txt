Yes!
Of course!
The firestones...
They are the key to your journey
These red titanite crystals can reignite your torch
You'll need to do this frequently to stay warm
Otherwise, you'll freeze!
SWITCH
All the lands you'll traverse through are very frigid...
So you must sustain your torch at all times!
But remember...
You can only use them once!
Once a firestone has been used...
You cannot use it again
The energy they provide is very limited...
So be sure to cover as much distance as you can...
And to use your torch to its near fullest
Only then should you use a firestone
SWITCH
Use them wisely, Ko
If things get difficult...
Don't be afraid to backtrack
For every great leap forward...
You always gotta take two steps back!
